# Fire-Prediction
## About
This app predicts wether or not there will be a fire depending on several factors such as humidity, temperature, region, type of area, etc. The user can input a number for numerical factors such as temperature and humidity, but can also choose options from drop down boxes for the categorical variables such as region and vegetation type. The output from all of these user inputs is if a prediction of if a fire will occur. The app also includes Deon's checklist at the bottom to ensure that the means of obtaining the data used for the app was collected ethically and that this app will be used in an ethical way. 
## Usage
The app can be run through hugging face (https://huggingface.co/spaces/kaylayi18/FirePrediction), and the required libraries in order to run this app are listed in the requirements.txt file included in the repository.
## Description
This repository includes the data preprocessing in google colab, the best/trained machine learning model, the app.py file that can be run through huggingface, and Deon's checklist.
